Hey, I'm Trevor! I'm interested in data science, artificial intelligence, programming, music, and a bunch of stuff in between. This site will chronicle various projects of mine.

***SITE IN PROGRESS***

*This is an early version of my blog, trevbook.com. I want to eventually build a more custom-made site, but in order to get things moving quickly, I decided to use Jekyll & GitHub Pages. (This theme is [the Jekyll Now theme](https://www.jekyllnow.com/about/).)*
